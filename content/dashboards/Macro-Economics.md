## Dashboard Overview

The goal isn’t to monitor every data point, but to surface the signals that matter most: whether macro conditions support annual price increases, where cost inflation is embedding in our P&L, and when emerging trends may signal trading risks ahead.

Plain-English descriptions

- **5y5y Inflation Expectations (T5YIFR)** : Market-implied long-run inflation — a ceiling for multi-year pricing assumptions.
- **CPI Services ex-Shelter (DSPIC96)**: Core services inflation removing shelter’s lag — best macro yardstick for ARPM price decisions.
- **Nonfarm Payrolls (PAYEMS)**: Monthly job creation — stronger hiring supports demand.
